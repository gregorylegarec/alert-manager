# 1 - Web application proposal

The proposal for a web application displaying and managing alerts is splitted in the following documents :

1. [Infrastructure](infra.md)
2. [Database](database.md)
3. [API](api.md)
4. [Back and Front conception](conception.md)

# 2 - Really simple application example

The example is made with React (using `create react-app`), rematch and Material-UI. It's a little bit oversized for our needs here, but it allows us a really quick set up.

To install the application example:

```
cd app/
yarn
```

To run the application:

```
yarn start
```

The application should be accessible on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
