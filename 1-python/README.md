# Python Algorithms

## 1 - Quote and backslash escaping

Run:

```
./escape.py "chain with 'quotes' and backslash : \"
```

> âš  Don't forget to escape the backslash if your shell needs it.

It's also possible to run tests:

```
python test_escape.py
```

## 2 - Anagram checking

Run for example:

```
./anagram.py "Astronomer" "Moon starrer"
```

It's also possible to run tests:

```
python test_anagram.py
```
